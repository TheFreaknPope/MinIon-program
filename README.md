<h3>Description</h3>

</p>Taking Fastaq file outputs from the MinIon sequencer. Creating Panda's DataFrames. For downstream data analysis.</p>

<h3>Work Flow Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take the fastaq output, convert them to fasta.</li>
<li>Create a database used to blast against.</li>
<li>Convert all the files into pandas DataFrames.</li>
<li>Figure out which directiong the sequence is being read from. </li>
<li>Figure out which parts are backbone and which are of the genes of interest. </li>
</ul>
